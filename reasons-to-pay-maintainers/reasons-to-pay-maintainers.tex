{\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{0.9}\Huge\raggedright Not Paying Open Source Maintainers Hurts Your Company\par}

Your company depends on the work of Open Source maintainers. You should pay those maintainers. Here's why.

\boldprim{Reason 1:} Paying maintainers allows you to \textbf{prevent stability and security problems} in your software.

If you don't pay for the Open Source software you use, the unpaid maintainers who create it are vulnerable to burnout,
causing your software to become less stable and secure, and leading to dangerous exploits such as Log4Shell or the XZ Utils
backdoor. Pay maintainers so your business doesn't rely on at-risk software.

\boldprim{Reason 2:} Paying maintainers is a way to \textbf{keep the Open Source innovation you rely on from
disappearing}.

Innovative Open Source projects have enabled us to watch YouTube videos, go to space, exchange medical records and keep
in touch with friends and family. But this innovation, which can only happen with an Open Source development model, is
vulnerable if maintainers cannot afford to pay the bills. To continue leveraging innovative Open Source software, pay
the maintainers who do the innovating.

\boldprim{Reason 3:} Paying maintainers will help you proactively \textbf{conform to new cybersecurity legislation}.

From December 2027, you will have to comply with the EU's Cyber Resilience Act, which requires you to ensure that the
Open Source software you rely on is secure. Open source software stewards (OSS foundations) â€” are the only ones that
can help. But at least 50\% of foundations say they have insufficient financial support to actually ensure CRA
compliance. Pay the foundations so they can help you comply with the law.

\boldprim{Reason 4:} By paying maintainers, you \textbf{show your customers you are a thought leader}.

Pay maintainers to show your customers that you are a thought leader that understands their field deeply and anticipates
problems before they occur. This helps your brand and gives you a competitive advantage. Open Source Pledge member
companies also get promoted regularly, be it on the Nasdaq tower in Times Square or on outdoor advertising in San
Francisco.

\boldprim{Reason 5}: Paying maintainers allows you to \textbf{build valuable connections with contributors}.

Open Source contributors, both to OSS libraries, and to your own OSS projects, allow you to leverage the skills of a
global base of specialised developers. Pay them to make sure they stick around.

\boldprim{Reason 6:} Paying maintainers lets you \textbf{make recruiting easier by attracting like-minded employees}.

If developers looking for work know that you pay maintainers because you take seriously the sustainability of the Open
Source ecosystem they work within, they'll be happier working for you than for your competitor. Open Source Pledge
members can show off their values by using our member badges, and showing their job postings on the Open Source
Pledge job board.
